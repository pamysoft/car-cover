                <p>Car covers are primarily divided into two kinds of categories. Outdoor covers, for protecting your vehicle against the elements, and indoor covers for protecting your car against more domestic hazards. CarCover.com caters to both of these circumstances and offers covers of various materials, thicknesses, and treatments that are balanced to best protect your vehicle at a variety of prices.</p>
                <p>Outdoor car covers can be either waterproof or water-resistant. Our premium Gold Shield 5L outdoor car covers provide excellent water resistance while ensuring 100% breathability. When a cover lacks breathability, it can lead to various issues such as the buildup of heat and moisture, limited air circulation, the accumulation of allergens, unpleasant odors, and more. Outdoor covers are the most common and most popular, and usually car owners' first investment.</p>
                <p>That car kept indoors - be it in storage or in a garage - does not need a cover, is a common misconception. Although it is always better to keep your car inside if you can (and the regular impossibility of this is why we supply outdoor car covers), just being inside is inadequate to properly guarding your vehicle's exterior. The often-tight space of a garage in addition to the presence of dust and debris makes it very easy to make unintended contact and leave scratches in your vehicle's paint, both large and small. Indoor car covers are designed, differently from outdoor covers, with these distinct perils in mind.</p>
